# DartsJS
## About
An basic and adaptable Darts Scoreboard in HTML and Javascript. It was built to be in one file and easily hosted on any basic server. (Made pretty with bootstrap)

This project will be added to during my freetime, but feel free to make changes and add new features. I've tried writing it as dynamically as possible to make modifying and adding features easy.

Hope this project brings out your inner [Luke Littler]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Littler') ü´°

‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREMELY BASIC CLIENT-SIDE PROTECTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED - NO SERVER-SIDE VALIDATION IS IMPLEMENTED MEANING PROTECTIONS CAN EASILY BE BYPASSED ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Getting Started
### Try it out
The tool can be accessed directly without installation via https://twidsdev.github.io/DartsJS/

### Docker
If you have docker and prefer to use docker, a docker-compose file is provided to get everything setup instantly. Depending on your preference, I have provided an Apache and Nginx docker-compose file. If you'd like Apache instead, just rename the `apache-docker-compose.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`. 

`git clone`

`cd directory`

`docker compose up`

Visit `http://localhost`

### Standalone
If you already have your own preference in server running you can simply copy the HTML file into your servers htdocs or public html directly.

### Python
`git clone`

`cd directory`

`python3 -m http.server 80`

Visit `http://localhost`
